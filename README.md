# Karma Party Ecommerce

> My first-rate Nuxt.js project

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

top level nuxt.config.js must be in same directory as top level package.json to find the .env/environment.json file

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
